===================

My personal website.

So, just for the record, this was a rapid build for a portfolio site (1 day
of work aproximately).

I tried to keep it as simple as it can, so here are a couple of things that I
use and have knowledge about that you won't see here:

* Modernizr
* Require.js
* OOCSS or BEM or SMACSS
* CSS and JS compression & minification
* SEO optimization
* Accesibility & validation :)
